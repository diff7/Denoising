# A script to generate noisy files 
for parameters see noise_config.yaml

- noise is added with different  snr values (snr_min, snr_max)
- noise and clean files should be provided
- white_noise: white noise is added randomly with some probability
- num_copies:  each clean file mixed with n noisy files so we get product at the end
